# Breast Cancer Prediction Using Feedforward Neural Network
## 1. Summary
The aim of this project is to create a highly accurate deep learning model to predict breast cancer (whether the tumour is malignant or benign). The model is trained with [Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)

## 2. IDE and Framework
This project is created using Sypder as the main IDE. The main frameworks used in this project are Pandas, Scikit-learn and TensorFlow Keras.

## 3. Methodology
### 3.1. Data Pipeline
The data is first loaded and preprocessed, such that unwanted features are removed, and label is encoded in one-hot format. Then the data is split into train-validation-test sets, with a ratio of 60:20:20.
